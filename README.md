# Goals

1. Put together a really lightweight topic-based blogging platform with clear separations between professional/personal/media posts. Must have some form of media tracker functionality with adequate tagging.
2. Learn to use some more recent backend technologies: serverless, graphql, express, nosql
3. Maybe look into using aws? Would be nice to understand how to deploy things properly from start to end
